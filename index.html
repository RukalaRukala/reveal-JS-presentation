						<h2>We follow these principles:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software</li>
							<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage</li>
							<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale</li>
							<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done</li>
							<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation</li>
							<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress</li>
							<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely</li>
						</ul>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility</li>
							<li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential</li>
							<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams</li>
							<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly</li>
